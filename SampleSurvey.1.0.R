#Title: Sample Survey 1.0
#Purpose: Clean code that creates a basic sample shiny survey with demographic questions, and also saves the survey responses into a 
#a Google Sheet.

###KEY NOTE: Something I noticed... when revising my survey, sometimes the survey would run, but the screen would be grayed out, and I'd 
###have red error text in my RStudio output window. You cannot fully test your code under these conditions (this is part of the reason I had
###saving issues...). That error(s) has to be resolved before testing saving and dependency functionality, and perhaps other code, as well. 
###You'll know the issue has been resolved because the survey screen will not be grayed out when you run it, and no red text will be in the output window.

# Define questions in the format of a shinysurvey

#All questions placed into a single data frame, with questions presented in order to be
#presented in the survey.
#for multiple choice items, questions have to be repeated for each response option.
#option: response options. For text, I put "Enter text here", which is shown in the box that appears below the question. For MC, 
#I enter each choice, one row at a time, in the order that I want the responses to appear in the survey.

#input_type = how are people to respond?
#Dependence = should the appearance of this item depend on another item?
#dependence value = how do you need to respond on the previous item to get this item to appear?
#required = do you need to respond to this item to continue? (TRUE = yes, FALSE = no)
#page = what page should this question appear on? (optional with single page survey)
